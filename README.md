# japanese-study-api

A quick project I am working on so that I can use japanese.io to find news, articles and other items and then favorite words and definitions and quickly create quizlet cards via quizlet import.

Quizlet:

Focus on the following quiz types as quizlet isn't built for Kanji + Definition + Reading. So we need to split this into Kanji + Reading and then Kanji + Definition. Generally we want two seperate decks. Kanji + Definition (w/ soft reading) and Kanji + Reading so that we can do both.

In addition I'm also including sentence examples which need to be worked into some lookup function on quizlet? Or just a review sheet or app. Maybe in the future I just built my own space-rept. learning thing w/ games.

Word (Kanji)
  -> Definition
  -> Reading
  -> Grade
  -> Example Sentences

If the word is a composite of multiple Kanji we lookup the Kanji base forms....
